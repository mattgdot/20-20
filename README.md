# Blinkzilla: Break Reminder App
Blinkzilla is a break reminder app that helps prevent digital eye strain.

This app lets you set a reminder for you to spend at least 20 seconds every 20 minutes away from your phone. You may look around, think about the things that make you happy, or even grab a glass of water. 

As prescribed by eye doctors, the 20-20-20 rule does not only prevent eye strains but will also help maintain healthy eyesight.
