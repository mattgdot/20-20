# 2020: Break Reminder App
2020 is a break reminder app that helps prevent digital eye strain and keep our 20-20 vision. 

Many of us often spend hours just tinkering around with our phones. This application lets you set a reminder for you to spend at least 20 seconds every 20 minutes away from your phone. You may look around, think about the things that make you happy, or even grab a glass of water. 

As prescribed by eye doctors, the 20-20-20 rule does not only prevent eye strains but will also help maintain healthy eyesight.

This is a fork of @ShaneMaglangit's project. I updated it to work on newer Android versions and will possibly rewrite it completely in the future.
